## About Me

I am Yung-Yueh Chan Lee from Taiwan.

I am currently a Full Stack Engineer at [Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)](https://www.itri.org.tw/). As a new member of the team, I look forward to sharing my professional journey and insights with you through this blog.

During my graduate, I was pursuing M.S. (2022-2024) in Bioinformatics Engineering from National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), where I conducted the research in gene prediction & analysis.
